- 👋 Hi, I’m @MatthewRohatynskyj currently a 1st year studying Computer Science at UoY.
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis, computer vision and machine learning within the scope of computing. In a wider scope I play guitar and piano, have an interest in chess and want to live a healthier lifestyle.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java OOP, Python data science using numpy and pandas, theory of formal language and automoton, human-computer interaction, building a virtual simple CPU using Xilinx ISE in the Systems and Devices module.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project which will progress my learning in the whole computer science field.
